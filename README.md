### Hello there 👋

My name is German, and I am always fascinated with programming, reading, finance, business sports, ecology, and IT. I've been interested in how technology and our lives may be combined. The computer has always been my means of realising my ideas; it has given me a brand-new, incredible tool with which to create things that have never been done before. I found the ability to understand how to mix up business and IT really significant.

I've been working in IT and software development since I started my job in 2020. I truly value the time I spent with such gifted and forgiving colleagues who helped me discover who I am. Please accept my sincere gratitude if any of those people are reading this. 

Eventually, my skills in data analysis and financial education propelled me farther into the software development field in my profession. However, I have never forgotten about business and finances, and in my free time, I read some articles about the financial world or financial news. It really helps me realise the business side of my job and easily find a command ground with my coworkers. 

I always improve my engineering skills by solving different algorithmic tasks and system design tasks. System design and IT in general are my passions.
